## <a name="lyra"> lyra</a>

![alt text][lyraConstellation]{: .center-image }

- **Vega** - brightest star in northern hemisphere after Arcturus, first star to other than the Sun to have a clear spectrum recorded, it's surrounded by a debris disk
- **epsilon lyrae** - Double Double, it's two distinct systems of binary stars
- **beta lyrae** - binary star composed of a blue bright giant and an early B-type star. In this case, the stars are so close together that the larger giant is overflowing its Roche lobe and transferring material to the secondary, forming a semidetached system. The secondary, originally the less massive of the two, has accreted so much mass that it is now substantially more massive, albeit smaller, than the primary, and is surrounded by a thick accretion disk
- **ring nebula** - it's the ring nebula, LOOK AT IT.

## <a name = "cassiopeia">cassiopeia</a>

![alt text][cassiopeiaConstellation]{: .center-image }

- **alpha cassiopeiae** - multiple star, four things: orange giant (m +2.2), yellow dwarf (m +8.9), two other stars (veeery dim)
- **gamma cassiopeiae** - prototype gamma cassiopaeia variable *([Shell stars](#shell)  often show variability in their spectra and brightness. The shell features may come and go, with the star changing from a shell star to a normal B star or Be star. Shell stars which show irregular variability due to changes in, or the disappearance of, the "shell" are called Gamma Cassiopeiae variables)*. Very easy to see. LOOK AT IT. More stuff, spectroscopically it's a binary star, but no direct evidence of the companion has been found.
- **delta cassiopeiae** - easy to see algol-type eclipsing binary star

<a name = "shell">shell stars - a star having a spectrum that exhibits features indicating a circumstellar disc of gas surrounding the star at the equator. They may exhibit irregular variations in their luminosity due to the outflow of matter</a>

## <a name = "orion">orion</a>

![alt text][orionConstellation]{: .center-image }

The seven stars of the hourglass asterism in orion are among the most distant that can easily be seen with the naked eye.

- **delta orionis (mintaka)** - binary star (B-type blue giant and O-type main sequence)
- **zeta orionis (alnitak)** - triple star (blue supergiant that happens to be the brightest class O star in the night sky, plus two bluish companions)
- **trapezium cluster (near M42)** - tight open cluster, disovered by galileo
- **M42, orion nebula** - one of the brightest nevulae, LOOK AT IT. Using binoculars, its clouds of nascent stars, luminous gas, and dust can be observed.

## <a name = "auriga">auriga</a>

![alt text][aurigaConstellation]{: .center-image }

- **Capella** - sixth brightest star. Spectroscopic binary consisting of two yellow giants (G-type and G- or F-type, respectively).
- **Menkalinan** - eclipsing binary
- **epsilon aurigae (rightmost star in image)** - unusual eclipsing binary system comprising an F0 supergiant and a companion which is generally accepted to be a huge dark disk orbiting an unknown object, possibly a binary system of two small B-type stars. About every 27 years, Epsilon Aurigae's brightness drops from an apparent visual magnitude of +2.92 to +3.83. This dimming lasts 640–730 days. In addition to this eclipse, the system also has a low amplitude pulsation with a non-consistent period of around 66 days.

## <a name = "taurus">taurus</a>

![alt text][taurusConstellation]{: .center-image }

- **taurids** - prolly won't see them, but they're a meteor shower that tends to happen during november
- **hyades** - open cluster, consists of a roughly spherical group of hundreds of stars sharing the same age, place of origin, chemical characteristics, and motion through space.
- **pleiades** - star cluster, lots of stuff in there

## <a name = "perseus">perseus</a>

![alt text][perseusConstellation]{: .center-image }

- **algol** - prototype of a group of eclipsing binary stars named [Algol variables](#avar), though it has a third member to make up what is actually a triple star system
- **mirfak + alpha persei cluster** - mirfak is the brightest star in the constellation, and it's the brightest member of the alpha persei cluster. INTERESTING. LOOK AT IT
- **zeta persei** - triple star system with a companion blue-white main sequence star of spectral type B8 and apparent magnitude 9.16 around 3900 AU distant from the primary, and a white main sequence star of magnitude 9.90 and spectral type A2, some 50,000 AU away, that may or may not be gravitationally bound to the other two.
- **X persei (juuust below zeta persei)** - binary star. The optical star X Persei has been classified either as an O-type giant or a B-type main sequence star. It is a Be star, rotating rapidly, and at times surrounded by a disk of expelled material. This qualifies it as a Gamma Cassiopeia variable. X Persei A is in orbit with a neutron star. VERY INTERESTING BUT DIM. TRY TO LOOK AT IT
- *The Perseus Arm is a spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy and stretches across the sky from the constellation Cassiopeia through Perseus and Auriga to Gemini and Monoceros. This segment is towards the rim of the galaxy.*
- **chi + h Persei** - double open cluster. ABSOLUTELY FUCKING LOOK AT IT. *The Double Cluster was first recorded during the reign of the Chinese king Tsung-K'ang, who reigned during the Xia dynasty (2858–2146 BCE)*

<a name = "avar">Algol variables</a> - An Algol binary is a semidetached binary system where the primary component is an early type, main sequence star that does not fill its [Roche lobe](#rlobe), while the cooler, fainter, larger, less massive secondary component lies above the main sequence in a Hertzsprung–Russell diagram and fills the Roche lobe. Early in its history, the secondary star would have been more massive, evolving first to overfill its Roche lobe. After rapid mass exchange, the lobe-filling star became less massive than its companion

<a name = "rlobe">Roche lobe</a> - the region around a star in a binary system within which orbiting material is gravitationally bound to that star. It is an approximately tear-drop-shaped region bounded by a critical gravitational equipotential, with the apex of the tear drop pointing towards the other star

## <a name = "aries">aries</a>

![alt text][ariesConstellation]{: .center-image }

- **sharatan** - spectroscopic binary star, one in which the companion star is only known through analysis of the spectra
- **mesarthim** -  binary star with two white-hued components, located in a rich field of magnitude 8–12 stars. LOOK AT IT *The primary, γ1 Arietis, is an Alpha² Canum Venaticorum variable star that has a range of 0.02 magnitudes and a period of 2.607 days. It is unusual because of its strong silicon emission lines.*

![alt text][uminorConstellation]{: .center-image }

- **polaris** - i mean, it's pretty neat, you can use it to calculate your latitude and everything. It is the brightest Cepheid variable star visible from Earth. It is a triple star system, the supergiant primary star having two yellow-white main-sequence star companions. LOOK AT IT
